          <iframe title="[ Number of Security Guard Approved Schools By NY County 2022]" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TGMIZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TGMIZ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="562" data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>
        The presence of security guards or law enforcement within a school setting provides many benefits that have to do with consistently keeping watch over students, faculty, and guests entering the building. There has also been a rise in the number of school shootings within the United States which has lead to more of a demand for more school security.

        The chart above shows how many schools within each county in New York state have schools with trained security guards. A lot factors into these numbers including county population, number of schools within each county, and crime rates per county.

        The top three counties with the most schools with security guards is New York county with 57 schools, Nassau county with 35 schools, and Queens county with 31 schools. All three counties are in New York's top ten most populated counties and adds to why they have the most guarded schools in the state. 

        A county having a high crime rate doesn't necessarily mean that they will have more schools with security guards. Counties with with low crime rates could have the funding to place security guards within their schools in order to keep low crime rates consistent.
